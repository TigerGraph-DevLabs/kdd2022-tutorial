## Next Steps
### Save Your Work
Make sure to download your notebooks if you made any changes to them. The GitHub repository is always available to download the stock notebooks, found [here](https://github.com/TigerGraph-DevLabs/kdd2022-tutorial). If you wish to load the data into your own TigerGraph instance, you can download the full data file [here](https://osf.io/vejrt?view_only=319a53cf1bf542bbbe538aba37916537). Then, use the notebook [initial_modelling.ipynb](https://github.com/TigerGraph-DevLabs/kdd2022-tutorial/blob/main/notebooks/initial_modelling.ipynb) to process the data and downsample it if desired. By default, the [data loading notebook](https://github.com/TigerGraph-DevLabs/kdd2022-tutorial/blob/main/notebooks/0-load_data.ipynb) uses the sampled data file.

### Join the TigerGraph Community
There are many ways to get involved with TigerGraph. You can join the [TigerGraph Community Forum](dev.tigergraph.com/forum) to ask questions, share ideas, and more. We also have a community [Discord Channel](https://discord.gg/bVNbRtv9nK) to chat with other TigerGraph users.
