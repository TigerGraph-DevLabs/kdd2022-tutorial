## Abstract
Machine learning on graph data has become a common area of interest across academia and industry. However, due to the size of real-world industry graphs (hundreds of millions of vertices and billions of edges) and the special architecture of graph neural net- works, it is still a challenge for practitioners and researchers to perform machine learning tasks on large-scale graph data. It typi- cally takes a powerful and expensive GPU machine to train a graph neural network on a million-vertex scale graph, let alone doing deep learning on real enterprise graphs. In this tutorial, we will cover how to develop and run performant graph algorithms and graph neural network models with TigerGraph [3], a massively parallel platform for graph analytics, and its Machine Learning Workbench with PyTorch Geometric [4] and DGL [8] support. Using an NFT transaction dataset [6], we will first investigate transactions using graph algorithms by themselves as methods of graph traversing, clustering, classification, and determining similarities between data. Secondly, we will show how to use those graph-derived features such as PageRank and embeddings to empower traditional machine learning models. Finally, we will demonstrate how to train common graph neural networks with TigerGraph and how to implement novel graph neural network models. Participants will use the Tiger- Graph ML Workbench Cloud to perform graph feature engineering and train their machine learning algorithms during the session.

## Speakers

### Victor Lee, Ph.D.
**VP of Machine Learning and AI, TigerGraph**

His Ph.D. dissertation was on graph-based similarity and ranking. Dr. Lee has co-authored book chapters on decision trees and dense subgraph discovery. Teaching and training have also been central to his career journey, with activities ranging from developing training materials for chip design to writing the first version of TigerGraph’s technical documentation, from teaching 12 years as a full-time or part-time university instructor, to presenting numerous webinars and in-person workshops.

### Parker Erickson
**Machine Learning Engineer, TigerGraph**

Parker received his M.S. of Computer Science from the University of Minnesota with a focus on machine learning in 2022. He is also the founding developer of pyTigerGraph, a Python package for interact- ing with TigerGraph databases. Formerly an intern at UnitedHealth Group, Parker worked on graph machine learning solutions for fraud detection, member similarity, training course recommenda- tion, pharmacy formulary rules, and call center analytics.
